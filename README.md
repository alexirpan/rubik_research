This is the code I'm using for a research side project. Basically, I'm throwing
neural nets at a Rubik's Cube to see how well the neural net can learn
the dynamics of a Rubik's Cube problem. Past research has shown the Rubik's
Cube is solvable with iteratively deepened A\* search, so this isn't about
doing something believed to be difficult. I'm more interested in finding out
how well a neural net can recreate/imitate search.

If I have time I'll update this README. This is highly unrefined research code
and as of now I have no plans to make it more readable to maintain it or make
it more readable to other people, becaues I need to get better results first.
Off the top of my head, you'll need at least Torch and the rnn library for Torch.
